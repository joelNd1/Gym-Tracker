# Gym-Tracker
was having a few issues when up loading to github so to make it run there are a few steps to get it running
step 1 
navaigate to the location where the gym-track app is located and move all files in the front end folder to the 'client' folder and then delete 'front-end' folder 
step 2 
in your terminal navigate to 'client' folder and run it with comand 'npm start'
then navigate to 'server' folder in terminal and run it with comand 'npm run devStart'

it should be running now :)
